# Result [Design -2]:
1. DC Analysis :
   *  The caluclated drain current matches the epected value based on power and voltage , 
   Id=5.56*10^-5 A.
   * By adjusting the MOSFETS(M1 and M2) channel Dimenssion the  current requirement was 
     successfully achieved ,
     M1 : L= 500nm , W= 950nm.
     M2 : L= 300nm , W= 1020nm.
2. Transient analysis :
  * The graph sows how the circuits behaves over time .
  * The response is smooth  , with not much  diistortions .
3. AC Analysis :
  * The AC response graph graph confirmms that circuits remains same for diffrent frequency  
  range .
  * The gain (3.8dB) and phase shift of nearly 180 degree align with theoritical expectations.
# Inference (Design-2):
* The experiment validates that by appropriately selecting the MOSFET dimensions (L & W), the drain current can be precisely controlled.

* The voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) helped in selecting the correct operating voltage (0.8V) for saturation.

* Impact of Width Adjustments:

M2 has a stronger influence on Id, meaning its width significantly affects the output current. Increase in width increases Id drastically and vice-versa.
M1 has a smaller influence, meaning changes in its width result in only minor variations in Id. Increase in qidth increases Id by small amounts and vice-versa.

* The design meets the expected performance criteria and follows theoretical predictions, demonstrating its feasibility in practical applications.
