Aim : To find DC operating point , find its gain using transient analysis and AC analysis.
Components : Mosfet , resistors , DC power supply .
Procedure :
* make the circuit connections as shown above.
* Connect the RD resistor to the drain terminal  and DC power supply to the gate terminal as well as to the resistor
* Connect the source terminal to the ground .
* Set the input voltage to 0.9v and VDD to 1.8v.
* Using formula for power ,
  P=V*I
  we will get the values of Id as ,
  Id = 5.56*10^-5A
  we have to get the output current , Id for the given circuits by adjusting the values of L and W
  Length and Width of a channel implementing new values is shown in the below figure

The Below Content shows the Values obtained from the DC Analysis :
2. Transient analysis :
 Procedure :
* we have to slect the Transient analysis command in the edit simulation command
* Give the stop timeas 1msec
* Run the simulation.
The Graph below shows the response of transient analysis :
